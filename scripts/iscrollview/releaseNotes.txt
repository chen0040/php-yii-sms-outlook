jquery.mobile.iscrollview
Release Notes

Version 1.2
===========

Non Backward-Compatible
-----------------------
- You no longer need to create a <div> to contain multiple scrolled elements. In fact, you
  shouldn't (it will interfere with pull-down/pull-up). It will now scroll all content that is 
  inside of the wrapper. iScroll itself only scrolls the first child of the wrapper, but the widget 
  now creates a <div> around your content to contain it. 
  
- Events have been renamed. They are now all prefixed with "iscroll_on". See the documentation.

- Now comes with a jquery.mobile.iscrollview.css file. Please add this to your header.

New Features
------------
- Pull-down/Pull-up to refresh is implemented. Please see the documentation on how to use.

- Now deals correctly with padding on wrapper. It removes the padding and transfers it to the
  inner <div> that it creates to wrap your scrolled content. You shouldn't have to do anything
  special now to scroll either normal or inset listviews, for example. You will have to remove
  any padding/margins you added in the past to deal with padding issues.

- By default, calls made to refresh() and resizeWrapper() while a page is not the current page
  are deferred to the next pagebeforeshow event for that page. There are options to control this.
  
- No longer uses jquery.actual or patched iscroll.js.

- Option to prevent touch hover in scrollers when using jQuery Mobile 1.0 or 1.0.1.

- Demo has been much expanded. It now has 5 tabs demostrating different features, has buttons
  to load either jQuery Mobile 1.0.1 or 1.1, and illustrates changing header/footer size with
  orientation.
  
- Includes patched version of jQuery Mobile 1.1, with fix applied for slow links from long
  listviews.

Performance
-----------
- Significantly faster than 1.1 - 10X or more faster at widget creation and refresh.

- Extensive logging system for tracing and measuring critical methods, events, and callbacks.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Correct sizing on Safari Mobile related to address-bar.

- Persistant footer plays hide-and-seek, moving in and out of the page during transitions. Deal
  with this when sizing fixed-height elements.
